This is an exciting project! The genre you are describing is technically known as a **Social Deduction** or **Logic/Elimination Game**.

The combination of *Detetive* (the Brazilian version of *Clue*/*Cluedo*) and *Olimpo* (by Nolo Games) creates a very specific structural goal: you want the classic "whodunit" logic puzzle, but streamlined (likely without the tedious dice-rolling and walking around a board) and spiced up with modern "Variable Player Powers."

Here is a deep dive into the system, history, and structure to help you build your replica.

### 1. The Core System: "Process of Elimination"

At its heart, this game is a logic puzzle hidden inside a social experience.

* **The "Envelope" Mechanic:** The game functions on a principle of **Information Asymmetry**. A random variable from each category (Who, Where, Weapon, Motive) is removed from the game (hidden).
* **The Distribution:** All remaining variables (cards) are distributed to players.
* **The Logic Loop:**
1. **Positive Information:** "I have the Knife card." (I know the Knife is *not* the answer).
2. **Negative Information:** "I asked Player B if they had the Knife, and they couldn't show me anything." (Player B does *not* have the Knife).
3. **The Solution:** When you have eliminated every possibility except one in a category, that remaining one *must* be in the hidden envelope.



### 2. History & Origins

To understand your fan game, you should look at the grandfather of the genre:

* **Origin:** *Cluedo* (known as *Clue* in North America and *Detetive* in Brazil by Estrela).
* **Creator:** Anthony E. Pratt, a British musician. He filed the patent in 1944.
* **Original Name:** It was originally titled *"Murder!"*
* **The Inspiration:** Pratt played "Murder Mystery" parlor games where guests would act out crimes. He wanted to translate that into a board game.
* **Brazilian Context:** *Detetive* became a cultural phenomenon in Brazil. While *Clue* involves a mansion, *Detetive* often evolved to have a slightly different aesthetic and character names (like Sargento Bigode), but the math remains identical.

### 3. Structural Analysis: The "Four Pillars"

Standard *Clue* uses three categories. Your game uses **four**, which increases the complexity and the "combinatorial space" (the number of possible solutions).

**Your Proposed Structure:**

1. **Suspect (Who)**
2. **Location (Where)**
3. **Weapon (How)**
4. **Motive (Why)** – *This is your key differentiator.*

**The "Olimpo" Twist (Nolo Games style):**
Nolo Games is famous for "Pocket Games"—minimalist designs that fit in a small box.

* **No Board:** Unlike *Detetive*, modern variations like *Olimpo* often ditch the board. There is no rolling dice to walk into a room. You simply take turns asking questions. This makes the game 50% faster and purely focused on logic.
* **Variable Powers:** You mentioned "special characters." In game design, this is called **Variable Player Powers**. In standard *Detetive*, everyone plays the same. In your game, one character might have the power to "Look at one card from a neighbor's hand" or "Block a question." This adds strategy beyond just logic.

### 4. Popular Variations & Adaptations

To make your fan game unique, look at how others have twisted this formula:

* **Clue: Master Detective:** An expanded version of the original with more weapons, rooms, and suspects. It introduced "Snooping" (looking at cards when landing on specific spaces).
* **Mystery of the Abbey:** A game heavily inspired by *The Name of the Rose*. It focuses on monks in a monastery. **Key mechanic to steal:** It introduces "Vows of Silence" or distinct restrictions on what you can ask.
* **Awkward Guests (Incómodos Invitados):** This is considered the modern "Clue Killer." instead of passing cards, players trade information cards. It uses a deck-building mechanic to solve the murder.
* **Kill Doctor Lucky:** A reversal of the genre. You are trying to *kill* the victim without anyone seeing you, rather than solving who did it.

### 5. Designing Your Fan Game: The "Paper Prototype"

Since you want to build a replica, here is the skeleton you need to construct:

**A. The Mathematics (The Deck)**
If you want a balanced game that isn't too long or too short, standard distribution is usually:

* 6 Suspects
* 6 Weapons
* 6 Locations
* 6 Motives
* **Total Deck:** 24 Cards.
* **Solution:** 4 Cards (1 of each).
* **Playable Cards:** 20 Cards distributed among players.

**B. The "Refutation" Mechanic**
You need to decide how players answer.

* *Style A (Classic):* Player to the left must show *one* card if they have it. If not, it passes to the next player.
* *Style B (Olimpo/Poker):* Public hints. "I assume it was the **Butler** with the **Knife**." Everyone who has either of those raises a hand (but doesn't say which one they have).

**C. The Powers**
This is where your theme shines. Powers usually fall into three types:

1. **Information Gathering:** "Peek at a card."
2. **Protection:** "Cannot be asked a question this turn."
3. **Disruption:** "Force another player to reveal a card to the whole table."

### Comparison Table

| Feature | *Detetive* (Classic) | *Olimpo* (Modern Indie) | Your Fan Game |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Categories** | 3 (Who, Where, Weapon) | Usually 3 or 4 | **4 (Who, Where, Weapon, Why)** |
| **Movement** | Roll & Move (Board) | None (Card/Turn based) | **None (Focus on Logic)** |
| **Pacing** | Slow (45-60 mins) | Fast (15-30 mins) | **Medium (Variable)** |
| **Powers** | None (Usually) | Yes | **Yes (Class/Character based)** |
| **Win Con** | Go to center & accuse | Accuse on turn | **Accuse on turn** |

### Recommendations for Research

If you want to refine the "Motive" aspect, look up **"Whodunit logic grid puzzles."** These are single-player paper puzzles that use the exact same logic structure you are trying to gamify.
