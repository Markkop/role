Here’s what I’m going to do: (1) name the *type of game system* you’re describing, (2) break down the core “engine” (why it works), (3) give you the history + major branches/variants, and (4) list the best adaptation ideas you can borrow for your own original game.

## What type of game is this?

What you described is a **competitive investigation / deduction game** built around a classic structure often called **“the missing card”**: you start with a known set of possibilities, secretly remove the true solution, and players use revealed information to eliminate possibilities until they can accuse. ([Wikipedia][1])

In **Clue/Cluedo-style** versions, the solution is usually **Who + Where + Weapon** (three categories), but many modern/spinoff designs add a 4th category like **Motive (“Why”)**, **Time**, **Method**, **Evidence**, etc. (That’s exactly the lever you described.)

## The core system (your “engine”), step by step

This is the stable “skeleton” shared by *Detetive* and similar games:

1. **Known categories** (suspects / places / weapons / motives).
2. **Secret solution**: remove one card from each category into a hidden envelope/stack (the “case file”). ([Wikipedia][2])
3. **Hand distribution**: everyone holds some of the remaining cards, creating **information asymmetry** (each player knows a different subset). 
4. **Suggestion + disproof loop**:

   * On your turn, you make a **suggestion** (a combination).
   * Other players **disprove** by revealing *one* matching card if they can, which tells you that specific card is **not** in the solution. 
5. **Private notes**: you track eliminations; the game is basically a race to solve the logic grid faster than others.
6. **Accusation**: when confident, you **accuse**. If correct you win; if wrong you usually lose/are out (depends on edition). 

In the *Detetive* (Estrela) rules PDF, you can clearly see the “separate cards into piles → envelope solution → suggest in a location → players show one matching card” flow, plus note-taking and a single-shot accusation. 

## Where these games came from (history + lineage)

* **Cluedo / Clue** (the big ancestor): devised during WWII by **Anthony E. Pratt**, first published by **Waddingtons** in 1949, and later owned/published by **Hasbro**. ([Wikipedia][2])
* It’s directly rooted in the **“whodunit”** detective-fiction tradition (crime as a solvable puzzle through deduction). ([Wikipedia][3])

That “suggest/disprove” loop is why Clue-like systems stayed popular: it’s simple, social, and creates constant micro-reveals.

## About the specific games you mentioned

* **Detetive (Estrela, Brazil)**: the rule structure matches the Clue/Cluedo family: envelope solution, suggestions, refutation by showing a single card, note sheet, and an accusation to win. 
* **Olimpo (Nolo Games, Brazil)**: I couldn’t find a full written rulebook page in the public web results, but Nolo’s own promo clips describe it explicitly as **“a Detetive-like”** experience with **Greek gods**, where each player is a **demigod** trying to discover **who destroyed the oracle**. ([Instagram][4])

So: same genre engine, different theme + likely different pacing/powers.

## Popular variations & adaptations (what designers change most)

Think of these as “branches” you can study and remix:

### 1) Faster Clue-like deduction (same logic, less downtime)

Common tweaks:

* Remove the board / movement (or make it lighter).
* Make suggestions available more often.
* Add structured ways to “peek” or “force reveals.”

### 2) Team / co-op investigation

Instead of racing each other, players solve together against time or a system. (This often adds a **story deck**, timers, or escalating constraints.)

### 3) Hidden-movement + deduction hybrids

Different feel: one player is “the villain” moving secretly, others deduce location over time (the deduction focus shifts from *which cards* to *where are you now*). The deduction-board-game overview calls out this “one vs all” line as a major investigation-game branch. ([Wikipedia][1])

### 4) Tech / media add-ons (apps, VCR, digital)

Clue itself has had media/tech adaptations:

* A **VCR-based** version in the 1980s (live-action scenes + cards). ([Wikipedia][5])
* A PC video game adaptation (late 1990s) that kept the same solution structure. ([Wikipedia][6])
* *Detetive* has editions that integrate an **app** for witness tips (per the Estrela manual). 

## The “design knobs” you can turn for your own game

If you want something that *feels* like Detetive/Olimpo but becomes your own, these are the most powerful changes:

1. **Category design (your 4th slot matters a lot)**

   * Motive (“Why”) is great because it supports theme, character powers, and storytelling.
   * Alternatives: *evidence*, *time*, *alibi*, *escape route*, *spell*, etc.

2. **How information is revealed**

   * Show **one card** (classic) vs show **a category** vs show **a count** (“I have 2 of those”) vs show **a constrained clue** (“Not Zeus, not Temple”).
   * Public vs private reveals (public speeds the game; private increases tension and skill expression).

3. **Downtime control**

   * Biggest weakness of classic Clue-likes is waiting while others take turns.
   * Fixes: simultaneous note updates, quick “ask” actions, rotating lead player, or structured mini-rounds.

4. **Powers / special characters**

   * If you add powers, keep them as **information tools** (peek, swap, block, force a reveal, ask a yes/no about a category).
   * Watch out: powers that *destroy* logic (too much randomness, or too many hidden exceptions) can make deductions feel unfair.

5. **Endgame pressure**

   * Classic: wrong accusation eliminates you. 
   * Alternative: wrong accusation costs points/time/cards so you can keep playing (usually more fun for casual groups).

## Quick (important) legal/design note for “fan replica”

You can generally reuse **mechanics** (deduction with a missing-card solution, showing a disproving card, etc.), but you should *not* copy **names, characters, story text, art, icons, board layout, exact card lists, or distinctive phrases** from existing games. If you aim for “inspired by,” change the theme/setting, categories, and presentation so it’s clearly original.
